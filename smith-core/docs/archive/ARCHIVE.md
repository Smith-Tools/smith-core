# Smith Core Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation showing the evolution of smith-core from a build analysis tool to a universal Swift patterns library.

## Archived Files

### `README-build-analysis-era.md`
**Era**: November 2024 - Build Analysis Focus
**Description**: Original README when smith-core focused on providing "shared data models and utilities for Smith build analysis tools"
**Key Features**:
- Project Type Detection for SPM/Xcode
- Build System Detection
- Shared Data Models for build analysis

### `Package.swift-build-analysis-era.md`
**Era**: November 2024 - Build Analysis Dependencies
**Description**: Package.swift configuration from the build analysis era
**Context**: Shows dependency structure when smith-core was part of the build tool ecosystem

## Evolution Summary

smith-core evolved from a **build analysis foundation library** to a **universal Swift patterns library** that:

- **Before**: Served the Smith Tools build analysis ecosystem
- **After**: Provides universal patterns applicable to any Swift project

This evolution represents a strategic shift from build-specific utilities to general-purpose Swift development patterns, making smith-core valuable to the broader Swift community beyond just Smith Tools users.

## Historical Context

This documentation is preserved to:
1. Show the thoughtful evolution of the library's purpose
2. Maintain context for contributors who may encounter older references
3. Document the strategic pivot from build-focused to universal patterns
4. Preserve the decision-making process for future architectural decisions
